 * Should be able to read a json file.
 * Upon bad formatting, closes with a failure state.
 * When successful, should be able to report an arraylist of arraylists of actions.
 *
 * Reminder to self:
 * So Essentially, the player should select when they wanna start a replay.
 * Warn the player about how their current game session will end.
 * They proceed, All the created saves should be presented in the next alert box. (gives an error if there is none and returns to their game)
 * They select a save, The json save should be loaded, via this reader, into the recorded changes. (gives an error on bad formatting and returns to their game)
 * Immediately resets the game, and loads the player in their beginning spot OF said recording (NOTE: you'll also need to deploy creatures
 * in their beginning spots too!)
 * All this class does is return "recordedChanges" however.
 *
 * In "Replayer" (recordedChanges should be loaded in RecordAndReplay) the player may use arrow keys to go left or right in the recording.
 * If there is no more recording, an alert should display "END OF RECORDING".
 * If the player rewinds too far, an alert shouldn't display but the Replayer shouldn't allow it to rewind.
